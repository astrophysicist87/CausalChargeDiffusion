Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic & Number Theory ($9.95)

Contents: 1) a package of arbitrary precision routines for
add,subtract, multiply, divide for integers, rationals, and
reals.  Conversion from rational to real, between type long and
integers, and between real and type double (uses sscanf, only
precision of type float achieved). Arbitrary precision integer
arithmetic for: greatest common divisor (gcd) of m,n (also finds
m',n' such that m'm+n'n=gcd), a^b mod c (or a^b when c=0) and
a*b mod c, generating and testing large primes, generating RSA
cryptosystem keys, encrypting & decrypting in RSA system, and
converting between number systems of different bases.  2) a
package to do basic number theory, using the above, including:
Jacobi and Moebius symbols, Jordan J, Mangoldt Lambda, Liouville
nu (count of prime divisors), prime factors, divisors, sigma
(sum of kth powers of divisors, k>=0), and calculate the
partition numbers p(n) and q(n) either by recurrence or
asymptotically.  There are caveats (specfied below) on using the
second package for factoring large numbers (greater than two
hundred million) or determining the number of partitions for
large numbers.  The factoring is done "brute force." A more
efficient method may be implemented in the future.  A table of
primes up to 16,384 is provided, which makes factoring
realtively efficient up to numbers below 268 million, beyond
which primes have to be generated and then used as candidate
factors.  Due to imprecisions in floating-point arithmetic, the
asymptotic results for p and q may not be exact, although the
formulae are in principle capable of exactly determining the
(integer) p and q.

Sparse Matrix Package. Includes linear system solvers using
Generalized Minimum Residual Method (GMRES), minmum residual
method (MRES) for general systems, and conjugate gradient method

decompostion for symmetric positive-definite matrices. 
Various preconditioning methods under development. In C.
